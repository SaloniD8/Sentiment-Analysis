 Overview
This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis, where we analyze text data to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. It involves Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models to classify sentiments based on textual input.

 Technologies Used
Python 
Jupyter Notebook 
Pandas & NumPy 
Scikit-learn 
NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing) 
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization) 

 Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains text reviews along with labeled sentiments. It has been preprocessed to remove noise, stopwords, and special characters.

 Features
 Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword removal
 Feature Extraction: TF-IDF / Word Embeddings
 Model Training: SVM, Naive Bayes, or Neural Networks
 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
 Visualization: Word clouds, Confusion matrix

How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/SaloniD8/Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Open Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb and execute the cells step by step.

 Future Improvements
 Integrate Deep Learning models (LSTMs, BERT)
 Deploy as a Web App using Flask/Django
 Improve accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
